#Tuple: ordered, immutable, allows duplicate elements
#The main Difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are immutable

mytuple = ("Max", 4, 5) # or you can just write = "Max",4,5
# If you want to create tuple that holds one element then add coma in the end
# mytuple = ("Max",)

#To turn array into tuple
toTuple = tuple([1,2,3,4,5])
